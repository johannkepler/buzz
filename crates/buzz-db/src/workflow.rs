    // -- Scheduled workflow claim confinement ---------------------------------
    //
    // RECONCILED spec (supersedes the earlier S1 lock; Eva/Max 2026-06-27).
    //
    // The earlier S1 lock asserted "`workflow_id` is globally unique, so the
    // claim resolves community server-side from `workflow_id` alone and the
    // caller never names it." The final schema does NOT have that property:
    // `workflows` PK is `(community_id, id)` and `scheduled_workflow_fires` is
    // keyed/FK'd by `(community_id, workflow_id, scheduled_for)`. Duplicate
    // workflow UUIDs across communities are explicitly allowed (and pinned by
    // the Issue-4 confinement tests below). So resolve-from-id-alone is both
    // unimplementable and unsafe: `WHERE w.id = $1` matches every community
    // holding that UUID and fans one claim across all of them.
    //
    // The invariant that survives is NOT "the claim never receives community";
    // it is "the community used for the claim is server provenance, never
    // client-controlled." For the global scheduler scan that provenance is the
    // `workflow.community_id` returned by `list_all_enabled_workflows()`. The
    // claim therefore takes `community_id` and binds
    // `WHERE w.community_id = $1 AND w.id = $2`, confining the claim row to the
    // intended tenant.
    //
    //   1. `workflows.community_id` is row-owned, NOT NULL, immutable.
    //   2. The claim binds `(community_id, workflow_id)` of the workflow row.
    //   3. Claim uniqueness is `(community_id, workflow_id, scheduled_for)`.
    //   4. `latest_scheduled_workflow_fire` / `attach_scheduled_workflow_run`
    //      are already community-scoped; `claim` now matches.
    //
    // `claim_confined_to_its_community` is the confinement lock: a dup workflow
    // UUID in A and B must claim independently (claiming A/id leaves B/id
    // claimable). The other two tests are characterization guards: same-window
    // race must yield exactly one winner, and pruning below the largest
    // interval breaks `latest_*` (the §5c retention rule Sami flagged).
